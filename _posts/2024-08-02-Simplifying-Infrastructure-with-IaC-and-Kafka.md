# **Introduction**

In today's tech landscape, managing and scaling infrastructure efficiently is essential. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Pulumi offer a streamlined way to automate infrastructure provisioning, ensuring consistency and reducing human error.

Apache Kafka, a robust real-time data streaming platform, powers many modern data architectures but managing its components—brokers, topics, connectors—can be complex. This blog will show you how IaC simplifies Kafka infrastructure management. We'll highlight key Kafka components and explore how tools like Julie Ops, Terraform, and Pulumi can make configuring and maintaining Kafka resources easier. Whether you're a developer seeking more control or an organization looking for efficient infrastructure management, this guide offers valuable insights into leveraging IaC for Kafka.

# **Why Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is crucial for organizations because it simplifies the creation and management of resources needed for your applications. As your infrastructure grows, IaC can save your engineers time and effort by automating the provisioning and configuration of resources, allowing them to focus on more complex tasks.

So, **what exactly is IaC?** It means defining your infrastructure through code. Whenever you need to make changes or add new resources, you modify the code, and the IaC tool will handle the configuration and deployment of those resources automatically.

**How Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Solves Key Challenges**

**Challenges**

**Centralized Inventory Management**

- Developers can request resource creation, but admins or leads still need to approve these requests.
- Tracking changes can be challenging. While code can be maintained in version control systems like Git, keeping an accurate and up-to-date inventory requires careful management.

**Reproducibility and Scalability**

- Without IaC, replicating resources and configurations from a pre-production environment to production is complex and error-prone.
- IaC simplifies bulk provisioning and deletion, making it easier to scale infrastructure up or down as needed.

**Automated Provisioning**

- Manual provisioning through a graphical user interface (UI) is labor-intensive and prone to errors.
- IaC enables automated provisioning, which is essential for implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices in DevOps.

**The Solution: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solves these problems by using code to manage and provision infrastructure across different environments. Here’s how IaC can help:

- **Faster Provisioning:** Automates the setup and configuration of infrastructure, speeding up the process.
- **Reduced Human Error:** Cuts down on manual work, which lowers the chance of mistakes.
- **Idempotency:** Guarantees that the infrastructure setup will be the same each time the code is run, even if it's run multiple times.
- **Fewer Configuration Steps:** Streamlines deployment by putting all configurations into code.
- **Elimination of Configuration Drift:** Keeps environments consistent and prevents discrepancies.

Tools like Terraform, Pulumi and JulieOps are popular for automating these tasks and making infrastructure management easier.

# **IaC Tools for Kafka**

Using IaC tools to configure and manage Kafka infrastructure can significantly simplify the process. Tools like Julie Ops, Terraform, and Pulumi can be used to automate the setup of Kafka components such as topics, connectors, and more. Here's how they help:

- **Julie Ops:** Focuses on managing Kafka configurations using GitOps principles.
- **Terraform:** Provides a declarative approach to infrastructure management, allowing you to define Kafka resources in code.
- **Pulumi:** Uses programming languages to define and manage infrastructure, offering flexibility in configuring Kafka components.

## **JulieOps**

JulieOps, formally known as Kafka Topology Builder, is an open source project licensed under MIT License. It has got over 350+ stars on github. It is a tool designed to simplify the process of configuring topics, role-based access control (RBAC), Schema Registry, and other components. JulieOps is based on declarative programming principles, which means that developers can specify what is needed, and the tool takes care of the implementation details. The interface of JulieOps is a YAML file, which is known for its user-friendliness and straightforwardness. With JulieOps, developers can easily describe their configuration requirements and delegate the rest of the work to the tool.

[julie-ops](https://julieops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) tool helps us to provision Kafka-related tasks in Cloud Infrastructure as a code. The related tasks are usually [Topics](https://julieops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/futures/what-topic-management.html), [Access Control](https://julieops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/futures/what-acl-management.html), [Handling schemas](https://julieops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/futures/what-schema-management.html), [ksql artifacts](https://julieops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/futures/what-ksql-management.html) etc. All these tasks are configured as [topologies](https://julieops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the-descriptor-files.html?highlight=topology) in julie-ops.

**Pre-Requisites**

## **Pulumi for Infrastructure as Code**

Choosing the right Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool is essential, as each offers distinct benefits. IaC automates infrastructure provisioning and reduces human error. Pulumi, for example, can provision a wide range of cloud resources available in Confluent Cloud. To use the Confluent Cloud provider in Pulumi, it must be configured with the appropriate credentials to deploy and update resources.

Similarly, Pulumi's Kafka provider can be used to manage any Kafka resources. Like the Confluent Cloud provider, it also requires credentials for deploying and updating resources. In this section, we’ll focus on using Pulumi to provision Confluent Cloud Topics and Connectors.

Pulumi supports multiple programming languages, including Python, TypeScript, Go, C#, Java, and YAML. For this blog post, we'll use TypeScript. Pulumi enables automation of the deployment process, leading to faster and more reliable infrastructure provisioning.

The Pulumi provider we use is based on the official Terraform Provider from Confluent Inc., ensuring broad compatibility across various languages and platforms.

**Provisioning Kafka Topics**

To provision Kafka topics with Pulumi, follow these steps:

**Define Cluster Arguments**: Specify the Kafka cluster where the topics will be provisioned. \


```
let clusterArgs: KafkaTopicKafkaCluster = {
  id: cluster_id,
};
```
**Set Kafka Credentials**: Provide the API key and secret for authentication. \


```
let clusterCredentials: KafkaTopicCredentials = {
  key: kafka_api_key,
  secret: kafka_api_secret,
};
```


**Configure Topics**: Define the configurations for your Kafka topics, such as retention policies and partition count.

```
let topic_args: KafkaTopicArgs = {
  kafkaCluster: clusterArgs,
  topicName: topicName.toLowerCase(),
  restEndpoint: rest_endpoint,
  credentials: clusterCredentials,
  config: {
    ["retention.ms"]: "-1",
    ["retention.bytes"]: "-1",
    ["num.partitions"]: "6",
  },
};
```


**Create Topics**: Instantiate and create the Kafka topics. \


```
const topics = new confluent.KafkaTopic(
    topicNames[i].toLowerCase(),
    topic_args
);
```
**Run Pulumi**: Save your code to index.ts, set the Confluent Cloud credentials, and run the following commands:

```
pulumi config set confluentcloud:cloudApiKey <cloud api key> --secret
pulumi config set confluentcloud:cloudApiSecret <cloud api secret> --secret
pulumi up
```
 \
 \
**Provisioning Kafka Connectors**

Kafka Connect integrates Kafka topics with external systems. We’ll focus on provisioning a Kafka Sink Connector that writes data from a Kafka topic to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).

**Define Connector Configuration**: Provide both sensitive and non-sensitive configurations. Sensitive information will be masked by Pulumi. \


```
let connector_args: confluent.ConnectorArgs = {
    configNonsensitive: {
      ["connector.class"]: "AzureDataLakeGen2Sink", // Connector class
      ["name"]: "Connector Name",
      ["kafka.auth.mode"]: "KAFKA_API_KEY",
      ["topics"]: topicNames,
      ["input.data.format"]: "JSON",
      ["output.data.format"]: "JSON",
      ["time.interval"]: "HOURLY",
      ["tasks.max"]: "2",
      ["flush.size"]: "1000",
      ["rotate.schedule.interval.ms"]: "3600000",
      ["rotate.interval.ms"]: "3600000",
      ["path.format"]: "'year'=YYYY/'month'=MM/'day'=dd/'hour'=HH",
      ["topics.dir"]: "<Directory in ADLS>",
    },
    configSensitive: {
      ["kafka.api.key"]: kafka_api_key,
      ["kafka.api.secret"]: kafka_api_secret,
      ["azure.datalake.gen2.account.name"]: azure_data_lake_account_name,
      ["azure.datalake.gen2.access.key"]: azure_data_lake_access_key,
    },
    environment: cluster_environment,
    kafkaCluster: cluster,
};

new confluent.Connector("pulumi-connector", connector_args);
```
**Run Pulumi**: If the Confluent Cloud cluster credentials are already set, run the following command to provision the connectors:

```
pulumi up
```
If the credentials are not set up, follow the steps for topic provisioning to set them up.

## **Terraform for Infrastructure as Code**

Terraform is a popular IaC tool that supports a wide range of cloud, datacenter, and service providers, including Azure, AWS, Oracle, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes. It uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to describe and provision infrastructure. The Pulumi provider for Confluent is built on top of the Confluent Terraform Provider.

**Provisioning Kafka Topics with Terraform**

**Initialize the Provider**

Start by specifying the Confluent provider in your Terraform configuration: 

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    confluent = {
      source  = "confluentinc/confluent"
      version = "1.13.0"
    }
  }
}
```
This installs the Confluent Cloud provider.

**Configure Confluent Secrets** 

Set up your Confluent credentials: 

```
provider "confluent" {
  cloud_api_key    = var.confluent_cloud_api_key    # Optionally, use CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY env var
  cloud_api_secret = var.confluent_cloud_api_secret # Optionally, use CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET env var
}
```
**Define Kafka Topics**

Configure the Kafka topics: 

```
resource "confluent_kafka_topic" "dev_topics" {
  kafka_cluster {
    id = var.cluster_id
  }
  for_each         = toset(var.topics)
  topic_name       = each.value
  rest_endpoint    = data.confluent_kafka_cluster.dev_cluster.rest_endpoint
  partitions_count = 6
  config = {
    "retention.ms" = "604800000"
  }
  credentials {
    key    = var.api_key
    secret = var.api_secret
  }
}
```
**Run Terraform Commands**

Initialize and apply your Terraform configuration: 

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```
